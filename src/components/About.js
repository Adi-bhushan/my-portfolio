        <p>
          I'm a passionate web developer currently in my 3rd year of study, with hands-on experience in building full-stack applications. My journey into coding started with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, and it has since grown into a full-fledged passion. I thrive on solving complex problems and creating seamless, intuitive user experiences. I'm actively seeking a challenging internship where I can contribute to meaningful projects, collaborate with a talented team, and continue to grow my skills as a developer.
